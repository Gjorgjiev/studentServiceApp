Student Service Desktop Application

This project contains two parts:  1) web application; 2) desktop application

2) Desktop application: Since this app will be used in more faculties, I have predefined the user and pass. You can check them in 'LoginFrame' class.
Once you have logged in, you can chose one of the majors that are listed in the dropdown menu and see if some student has registered.
If yes, then you can chose either to accept them or reject.



Go to 'master' branch

Download the project and run it through the 'Login' class.

And feel free to play around :)

In order to see the full functionality of the project, download my studentEnrollmentSystem repository.
Read the README file in both repositories.
